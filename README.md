# Custom theme for ZSH

The default seems to update its git status marker only after running `git status`. This version is dumber and quicker, which I aspire to.

The theme file lives in:

`/home/${USER}/.oh-my-zsh/themes/xander-king-theme.zsh-theme`

and the `.zshrc` entry is

`ZSH_THEME="xander-king"`
